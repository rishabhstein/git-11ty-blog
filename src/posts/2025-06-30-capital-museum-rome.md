A few weeks ago, I was in Rome with my wife, and it turned out to be an exhausting trip, filled with mixed emotions. Like any touristy city, there were plenty of street sellers who were approaching people to sell souvenirs, food, and water bottles. It was irritating at times, but I kept reminding myself that I was walking through the city of Stoics--the same streets where **Marcus Aurelius** and **Seneca** once walked. So, I stayed calm and wandered the city as they might have done. We visited many places in *Rome*, including the famous **Colosseum**, its adjacent archaeological sites, “Roma Forum”, and several nearby museums. Honestly, each visit deserves its own post, but for now, I will limit myself to sharing my experience of visiting the Capitoline museums, aka “Musei Capitolini”. 

The reason for posting first about this particular museum is my fascination with Stoicism. I have mentioned it [earlier](/posts/2025-06-23-wisdom-from-roman-empire) in my blog.

This museum is situated in the heart of Rome at the hilltop square (Piazza del Campidoglio). It contains many precious gems of the Roman Empire, such as the remains of ancient Roman temples, pottery, graffiti, and many historical statues such as the She-wolf, Socrates, and Marcus Aurelius. Entering this museum made me feel like I was entering in real Roman kingdom. Although there was a lot to see there, I focused only on looking for Stoics. This was partly because of a lack of historical knowledge and partly because of my tiredness as we were walking almost 15-20km every day. However, in the museum I found only one Stoic, Marcus Aurelius. It was still an amazing feeling to be there, to stand right next to his statue and feel its power. I haven't taken many photos from that museum, but wherever I saw Marcus, I asked my wife to take my photo with him. Every encounter with him was an emotional one, as if a student were meeting his Guru. However, the meeting was taking place around 2000 years later of the existence of the Guru.

I also came across Commodus—-Marcus’s only son-—who was posing in a Hercules costume. What a pompous charlatan!!. I laughed and cursed him for his stupidity, which eventually led to his assassination. Seeing him also reminded me of his portrayal in the Gladiator movie—-I was watching it during this trip—-where he kills Marcus Aurelius. Although the movie is pure fiction, and historians believe that Marcus died of natural causes, reading about Stoics and Marcus’s only book, “Meditations” made me feel the plausibility of the hypothesis proposed in the movie. After all, Commodus was a fool and an immoral man, in stark contrast to his father, who was famous for his wisdom.

Anyway, I am not here to challenge historians, and I might be an emotional fool. But seeing Commodus as a successor of Marcus did not feel right, especially considering that Marcus--and the four emperors before him--were not born kings but were selected and trained by reigning emperors. Ruminating on this, I finished my visit and went home.
