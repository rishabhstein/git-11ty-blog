After such a hectic day, I was reading a blog series [People and Blogs](https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-ben-werdmuller) and today's guest said something very important when he was asked about the *creative environment* for blogging.  

> The quality of my writing is directly impacted by the quality of my reading. If I’ve only been reading social media that day, my writing is anxious, poorly-framed, and staccato. If I’ve been reading long-form pieces, I find that it’s calmer and more reflective. It’s at its best when I’ve been reading a really good book.   

Normally, people can not observe this or they might not be even aware of any correlation between their attention span and the type of material they consume. It's like a [fish and water problem](https://sigmarootpi.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=fish_and_water_problem), where changes in water might not be felt by the fish, but it can adversely effect its life by slowly paralyzing it and ultimately killing it. Modern social media brought that small change in our environment with short-term entertainment, such as shorts and reels, as addictive drugs. These drugs do give short-term pleasure on consumption but also adversely affect your mental resources which you need for a normal life. 

So if you want to save your mental resources, try to avoid social media as much as you can.
