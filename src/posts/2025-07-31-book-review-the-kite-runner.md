This was my second book from **Khaled Hosseini**--the first one was *And the Mountains Echoed*--and it was a roller coaster of emotions, making me feel angry, disgusted, sad, and sometimes even crying. I decided to read this book after **Senecca**, in one of his letters (2000 years ago) to Lucilius, suggested sticking to the writers you admire instead of getting lost in the black hole of exploration. However, I think it's also better to check out new ones from time to time.

The story is set in *Afghanistan* around 1970-80, before the *Taliban* took it over. It centers around two boys, *Amir* and *Hassan*, where Amir belongs to a rich family and Hassan is the son of a servant. They also differed religiously, where Hassan was born to a Hazara family--an outcast group of people--while Amir had Sunni parents. Despite these differences, thanks to Amir's generous father, they both grew up together, being nursed together by the same woman. There was a strong bond between them, but sometimes Amir felt jealous of Hassan, especially when Amir's father showed affection for Hassan, as if he were his own son. Hassan, on the other hand, was loving and caring towards Amir. He stood up for Amir several times whenever other boys bullied him. Regardless, they were mostly inseparable. They played around together all day, climbed trees, and loved flying *kites*. Amir was great at flying kites while Hassan was the best kite runner--a person who chases a Kite--in Kabul.

This game of boys went on until something bad happened to Hassan, and Amir could not defend him. Over time, the differences between the boys increased, and later, as the war started, Amir escaped to America with his father. There, Amir started a new life, graduated in literature, got married to an Afghan immigrant girl, and became a successful writer, unaware of Hassan being alive or dead. Despite his success, Amir carried a lifelong guilt for his betrayal of Hassan. 

When the Taliban took over, the situation worsened in *Afghanistan*. Amir was summoned to a neighbouring country, Pakistan, by a close acquaintance, Rahim Khan, to atone for his wrongdoing with Hassan. Amir went to the war zone in Afghanistan. What Amir found there... is worth reading.

It will shake you. It might make you cry. It made me cry.

I finished this book an hour ago, within nine days of starting it. I was so hooked to it that it became my fastest read ever. What was mesmerizing for me was not just the storyline but also the Afghani language. There are so many similarities in modern Hindi, my mother tongue, and Afghani that I felt an immediate connection to Afghan culture. For instance, the words *nah-kam, bache, naan, tanhaai, tar (wire), bevajah, and many more* are still common in Hindi. It might be obvious to you if you are a historian or linguist. But it wasn't for me, especially in this era of (mis)information, where politicians completely ignore real history and manipulate the truth.

The writing style of Hosseini is so influential--I have observed the same in his other books--that the characters become part of you. You live with them, speak with them, as if you were the character, yourself. I still can recall the character of Neela Wahdaati from his previous book *And the Mountains Echoed*. Similarly, in the current book, it was Amir and Hassan who felt unforgettable to me. I still feel the sadness that surrounded me when Hassan murmured to Ali in their very last meeting:

> For you a thousand times over

Throughout the book, Hosseini maintains this poetic style, quoting poets such as **Rumi and Khayyam**. That's the strength of this book. Even though it belongs to a historical fiction genre, Hosseini's description of Taliban dominance in Afghanistan and their treatment of Afghans is very realistic. It was heart-wrenching to read about the brutal killings of innocent people in the name of God.

Finally, time for my ratings. It was a moderate-sized book, and I found it deeply moving. It deserves at least 4.5 stars out of 5.
