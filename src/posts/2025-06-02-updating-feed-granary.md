Hello. I have mentioned earlier in a previous [post](/posts/2025-05-13-moving-to-11ty/) that I am working on moving my blog from [Aurora]() to [11ty](). Today I moved most of my blog to *11ty* so if you are reading this post in a browser, you are seeing the version powered by *11ty*.

Now one of the tricky part is keeping the **RSS** feed working and untouched so that subscribers, if there is any, won't see any weird behavior. The worst case scenario is the broken *RSS* feed. The reason for this is Aurora does not have any native *RSS* generator and depends on an online service such as **Granary** to convert HTML page to RSS feed. 11ty, on the other hand, is a popular blogging engine and does support native *RSS* generation. So good news is "now this blog has its own RSS feed".

So I am writing to you all my dear subscribers that 

**The RSS FEED URL is changed now. So please update it** 

from

[https://granary/WHATEVER/IT/WAS/EARLIER]()

to

[https://sigmarootpi/feed.xml](https://sigmarootpi.com/feed.xml)

I will also add it as a warning in future posts at least in 5 upcoming posts.
