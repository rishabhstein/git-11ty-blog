I was reading *Letter of a stoic* by Seneca and in the latest chapter I was surprised by advance nature of Seneca's thoughts--truly ahead of his time. He mentioned how people used to treat their slaves in his forefathers time--the master was regarded as a father figure and even was addressed as such--whereas in his time slaves were treated mostly with disgust and inhumanity.

Although we abandoned slavery in most part of the world, violence toward the most vulnerable people still survived to this time. I have seen it in previous generation. To our shame, Seneca argued, almost 2000 years ago, that beating is for animals. So slaves (lets call them vulnerables) should be treated with respect and in friendly manner. This was remarkable to see, considering people still do violence, that these thoughts exists from so long time. Seneca was not aware of any known religion of modern times and yet he spoke similar human values.

I wanted to share this because reading historical texts is always amusing to me, for the wisdom they contain, which many of us still lack. Whenever I read them,  I feel as though I am travelling back in time, having a conversation with an author, who lived several hundreds, if not thousands, years ago. Isnâ€™t that fascinating!!.
