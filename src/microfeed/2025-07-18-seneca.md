The temperament that starts at the sound of a voice or chance noises in general is an unstable one and one that has yet to attain inward detachment. It has an element of uneasiness in it, and an element of the rooted fear that makes a man a prey to anxiety as in the description given by our virgil:

> And I, who formerly would never flinch  
> At flying spears or serried ranks of Greeks,  
> Am now alarmed by every breeze and roused  
> By every sound to nervousness, in fear  
> For this companion and this load alike.
