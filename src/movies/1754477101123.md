I love to watch documentaries especially of David Attenborough. He did it again.

With strong narrative and amazing visuals, this documentary blew up my mind. I was sad to see the craziness of fishing industry using *Sea Trawler* for mass fishing even when they only use single specie. Rest is just garbage. Wow!!!

Who allows it? Itâ€™s so inefficient, killing all marine life just for one type of fish.

Anyway, I highly recommend it.
