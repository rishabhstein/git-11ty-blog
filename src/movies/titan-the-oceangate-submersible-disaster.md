Its hard to judge a documentary, at least for me, but it was an interesting one. I was waiting for it as I was curious from the day it happened. The documentary develops slowly, revealing bit by bit about the incident.

What it shows is that Stockton was a crazy old man who was ignorant as well as over confident. He didnt listen to other experts--probably thinking they were loosers. And in the greed of fame and money he killed himself as well as others.
