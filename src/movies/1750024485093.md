This movie is based on a book *The Case That Shook The Empire* by *Raghu and Pushpa Palat*, which tells a story of a star Indian attorney, *Shankaran Nair*, of British empire. Ironically he backfires and sues the empire of Jaliyanwala massacre.

Despite of having such charismatic character, the movie fails to utilise its potential. The movie develops fast, giving less time for contemplation. Most of the  movie is a courtroom drama where the Bollywood effect is visible: a lot of yelling of lawyers to provoke the witnesses so that they make mistake which ultimately prove that *General Dyer* was guilty.

Akshay Kumar as Nair did a good job with R. Madhavan played very well for loosing side. The end we all know so I wont repeat/spoil it.
