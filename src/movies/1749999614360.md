I think a good sci-fi movie is rare in these days of mass production when big houses like Netflix is releasing movies/documentaries almost every day.

This was a pretty decent movie with a weird storyline where a genius politician deal with a more intelligent (ahemm..) alien species. This puts it in the category of **Dont Look Up**. So if you like latter one, you might like Mickey 17.
