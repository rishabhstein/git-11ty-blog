I started watching this movie in my flight to India but I couldnâ€™t finish it that day. Today I finished watching it and I felt that it was the least good movie in Black Panther series. Chadwick Boseman had his own charm in all previous Black Panther movies. Shuri, on the other hand, was just grieving throughout the movie. Her dialogue deliveries were full of short outbursts. For instance she spoke **Wakanda Forever** around two times but almost in yelling manner without any emotion.

I think this movie deserves 3/5 stars.
