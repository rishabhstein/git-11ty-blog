title: "Colophon"

This blog is entirely made with an ancient CGI-script-based static site generator, [PyBlosxom](http://pyblosxom.github.io/). Sadly, the latest version still lacks support for *Python 3*. However, I somehow managed to run it using *Python 2.7* on some of my systems, but not all.

For hosting, I was previously using a well-known combination of **GitHub** and **Cloudflare**, with a domain bought from **Namecheap**. Right now, everything is proudly hosted from a corner of my home on **Raspberry Pi 5** by tunneling through Cloudflare.

One key feature of my blog is my self-hosted [Encyclopedia](https://sigmarootpi.com/dokuwiki/), which previously existed in the form of [notebooks](https://sigmarootpi.com/notebooks/) but a few weeks ago I moved it to [dokupedia](#). It is also running on **Raspberry Pi 5**.
