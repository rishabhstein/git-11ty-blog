This is a hidden gem in a small town of Poland, Chęciny. I was here last week for a week-long summer school of Soft-matter physics.

I was surprised to know that this cemetery dates back to 17th century. You can read about it [here](http://cmentarze-zydowskie.pl/checinyang.htm). Someone told me that the language used on this gravestone is Yiddish. It might be wrong but using ChatGPT this is the translation:

“Here Lies Rabbi With all his deeds, the Righteous one who Passed away quickly. May his spirit come To repentance”
